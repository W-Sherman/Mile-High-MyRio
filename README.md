# Mile-High-MyRio
ME/AE6705 Mechatronics Final Project (Mile-High-MyRio) - Will Sherman &amp; Stef Crum

# Introduction
In the pursuit of pushing the boundaries of innovation and technology, the "Mile High MyRio" project emerged as a pioneering venture in the realm of high altitude weather balloon missions. This endeavor sought to elevate a MyRio microcontroller—a versatile and programmable embedded system—to the remarkable altitude of 100,000 feet, exposing it to the harsh conditions of the stratosphere. The primary objective of this project was not only to navigate the challenging environment at such altitudes but also to orchestrate a controlled descent, involving a ballistic phase followed by parachute deployment, ensuring the safe return of the MyRio microcontroller to the Earth's surface. 

As the stratosphere presents a unique set of challenges, including extreme temperatures and low atmospheric pressure, the Mile High MyRio project aimed to demonstrate the resilience and adaptability of the MyRio microcontroller in the face of these adversities. By orchestrating a demonstration mission, this project aimed to contribute valuable insights into the capabilities of the acquired knowledge in our mechatronics class. 

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Mile High MyRio project, detailing the design, implementation, and outcomes of the mission. From the initial conceptualization to the attempted execution of the high altitude weather balloon launch, ballistic descent, and parachute-assisted recovery, each phase is examined to shed light on the challenges encountered and the lessons learned.
